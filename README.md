# Yokeless Segmented Core Axial Flux Motor

I was learning about different types of electric motors and stumbled upon Axial Flux motors which I had never heard about before. That led to a deep dive on how they worked and since I read they're the future of EVs I thought *Hey, what better way to understand them than to design one myself!*

During this project I learned about:
- Electric motor housing cooling methods
- Sand and Investment casting
- Bearings and bearing arrangements
- Spline shafts
- Solidworks explosion animations and a lot about Solidworks Visualize
- Generative AI in design
- that I took a break from using Catia for a reason ðŸ˜…

## Solidworks Visualize
